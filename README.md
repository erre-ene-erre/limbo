LIMBO is a curatorial collective based in Geneva, Switzerland. It currently manages Zabriskie, an independent art space housed in a former glass-walled bus shelter in the heart of the city. The collective aims to dissolve barriers between artistic practices by blending mediums, encouraging cross-disciplinary collaborations, and creating shared experiences among artists from diverse backgrounds.

LIMBO’s website reflects its multidisciplinary approach and plays with the idea of “limbo” as an uncertain, in-between state. Drawing on zine, punk aesthetics and Kathy Acker’s cut-up technique, it embraces visual disruption through a playful mix of fonts and styles.
