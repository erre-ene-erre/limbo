Eventinfo: <p>In the end, what is a flag? Each pair of works presented in this program answers this question in its own way. The guest artists choose the next artist, creating a chain that travels the world. </p><p>Jan Pieter Karper vit à Amsterdam, troisième participant à la chaine d’invitation, il a été invité par Andrea Salerno.</p><p>Jan-Pieter is the third artist in the chain of invitations. He lives and works in Amsterdam and was invited by Andrea Salerno. Jan-Pieter has chosen to work on the photographic representation of an open hand, which he shows us seen from the inside on one flag, then from the outside on the second. Thanks to the two sides of each flag, the photograph of a hand is transformed into a spatial sequence of four images that seem to interact with each other at the whim of the weather. </p><p>Photos Jeanne Tullen </p><p>Poster Cholé Pannatier </p>
