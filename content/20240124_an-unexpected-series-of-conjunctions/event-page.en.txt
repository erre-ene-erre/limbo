Eventinfo: <p>In the end, what is a flag? Each pair of works presented in this program answers this question in its own way. The guest artists choose the next artist, creating a chain that travels the world.</p><p>Andrea Salerno, who lives and works in Amsterdam, is the second artist to take part in this flag chain project. He was invited by the first artist in the chain, Melina Wilson. </p><p>Andrea plays with the star symbol, both an important subject of pictorial representation throughout the centuries and the main form used in flag design. He has listed all the nations recognised by the UN, collected their stars and inserted them into two flag compositions, one for each hemisphere. He tells us, "I want to create a series of transnational flags, sending a positive message of friendship and cooperation in a world where national identity seems to be experiencing a dangerous and shocking new wave of enthusiasm."</p><p>Photos Guillaume Python</p><p>Poster Chol√© Pannatier</p><p></p>
