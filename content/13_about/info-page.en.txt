Info: <p>LIMBO is a project space for artistic experimentation and critical reflection located in the Eaux-Vives district of Geneva, Switzerland. </p><p>It was born from a desire shared by four young artists, Yassine Gheribi, Henry Drake, Pablo Rezzonico Bongcam and Sophie Conus, to make available to young creators from the region as well as Europeans, a space for sharing and exhibition to question the reality of a city at the crossroads of cultures, powers and issues of the globalized world. </p><p>The places, located in a changing area on the border of the economic center of the city and its cross-border residential areas, also invite us to think about the limits within the urban fabric itself. More broadly, LIMBO sees itself as a platform dedicated to the interstices, to the in-between spaces that we inhabit, whether culturally or geographically, to try to make visible and thus question the intermediate, hybrid and mixed spaces, of the time, territory, cultures, identities and beliefs, while claiming and affirming their autonomy. </p><p>LIMBO is above all a collective project, a ground for meetings as well as testing collaborations in all directions, with the invited artists and creators, but also, and above all, between the members of its hard core.</p><p>The places, located in a changing area on the border of the economic center of the city and its cross-border residential areas, also invite us to think about the limits within the urban fabric itself.
