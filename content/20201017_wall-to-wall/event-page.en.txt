Eventinfo: <p>Wall-to-Wall</p><p>Painting / Location / Food free price</p><p>Meals on Saturday 17.10 at 12pm and 8pm, and brunch on Sunday 18.10 at 12pm. Cooking by Garance Raynaud and LIMBO Team.</p><p>For a weekend, LIMBO welcomed Bisso Yan Stéphane and Eliot Möwes, whose respective gestures and pictorial techniques took over the former bodywork shop on Avenue Rosemont. Invited to make their painting, in the sense of gesture rather than finished object, the focus of an ephemeral space of exchange, they wove together an environment made of signs and images traced under the gaze of visitors. </p><p>The space remained open continuously throughout the weekend, and free-price meals were served on Saturday lunchtime and evening, as well as a brunch on Sunday. </p><p>Bisso Yann Stéphane was born in 1998 and lives and works in Geneva. His work, initially pictorial but also sculptural and installation-based, is an exploration of the relationship between the individual and the community, and their respective geographical and cultural roots. Drawing on traditional Bulu memories and symbols, narratives passed on orally by his mother in the form of chantefables, and an animist heritage, Bisso Yan Stéphane develops a floating, colorful and generous visual language that seems to deal with a world without places, made up of dancing memories, multiple belongings and autonomous images, emancipated from any explanatory or historical narrative. </p><p>Eliot Möwes was born in 1996 and lives and works between Lausanne and Renens. His painting practice, strongly influenced by his interest in graffiti, calligraphy and the mechanical production of images, takes the form of a graphic dialogue between the supports, techniques, media and subjects of his work. Eliot Möwes' minimal black-and-white images constantly move back and forth between mechanical and manual processes, figuration and abstraction, object and plane, while constantly inviting urban space into the interiors he proposes to inhabit. </p><p>Poster: Bisso Yan Stéphane and Eliot Möwes</p><p>Photos: Yann Biscaut and Eliot Möwes Limbo Team</p><p>Translated with DeepL.com (free version)</p>
