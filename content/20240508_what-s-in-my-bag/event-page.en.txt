Eventinfo: <p>What’s in my bag ? - created for the space of Zabriskie - wants to display an unstable and dissociative body through the alteration of each senses as a desire to become else. Partaking with the concept of escapism, the performance is an absurd and abstract tutorial to exist nowadays. <em>What’s in my bag ?</em> - a title drawn from an online trend which oscillates between voyeurism and para-social dynamics - aims to display other ways to relate.  An unboxing of various objects where each of them unpacks or conceals another unhinged obsession.</p>
