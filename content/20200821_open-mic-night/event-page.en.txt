Eventinfo: <p>Open Mic Event</p><p>Writing workshop / reading / performance </p><p>With a view to including a literary dimension in its programming, LIMBO invited artist Annabelle Galland to lead a series of encounters around text. </p><p>The first event resulting from this carte blanche took the form of an evening open to participation. Texts were read and/or performed at the back of the garage, seated on carpets around a cup of tea. </p><p><em>Poster &amp; Visuals: Annabelle Galland</em></p><p><em>Photos: Limbo</em></p>
