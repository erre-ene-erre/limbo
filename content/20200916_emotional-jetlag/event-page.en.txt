Eventinfo: <p>Emotional Jetlag</p><p>Performance / Sound / Market </p><p>Performance evening on 16.09, sound broadcast evening on 21.09 and market on 23.09.</p><p>The "Emotional Jetlag" exhibition invited performance artists to weave narratives and installations inside cars parked at LIMBO. The proposals, centered around sound, text and performance, were all brought to life in the intimacy of personalized vehicles, transformed into stages or installations to be inhabited. </p><p>The car, with its symbolic weight and the narratives it suggests, provided an opportunity to observe, as through a prism, the sense of nostalgia that accompanies the general acceleration of our times, in the form of low-fi performances/sketches/scénettes.</p><p>Participating artists : </p><p>Pauline Coquart + Nelson Schaub </p><p>Xheneta Imeri + Alexandra Salem </p><p>Chaïm Vischel + Camille Buhler</p><p>The week was accompanied by two events open to participation - calls for contributions were launched on social networks and gave rise to two evenings - one around sound and proposing to listen to a selection of sound pieces through car radios; and the other consisting of a market whose various stands happened to be the open trunks of cars.</p><p>Sound contributions : Michael Alexander (GB) ; Solène Colin (FR) ; Rasmus Daugbjerg (DK) ; Annabelle Galland (CH) ; Michele Perna (ES) ; Cassiane Pfund (CH) ; Balam Ronan (MX) ; Johan Rosset (FR) ; Ilana Winderickx (CH). </p><p><em>Poster &amp; Visuals: Melchior Best</em></p><p><em>Photos (Limbo Team)</em></p>
